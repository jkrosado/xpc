# XP Classic (beta) by shiypc

A Windows XP Classic theme for Windows 96.

## How to install
Place the xpcb (or xpc depending on version) folder inside the `C:/system/resource/themes` folder, reboot, and select the theme from Display Properties.

## Bugs
If any bugs arise, please add me on Discord at @shiypc and I will try my best to get back to you. You may also reach me from the Windows 96 Discord server (the Doordisc icon on the desktop).

## Credits
The window color and start menu base are written by the Sys36 team and are already system components. Aside from minor visual tweaks to those, I claim no ownership over the code from those items.

The Windows logo is property of Microsoft.

Font code, start menu theme, start button icon, and other aspects are created by shiypc.
